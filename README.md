## Conclusion

## Future Improvements
- I  want to add a way to verify that its a real email and real phone number maybe by doing somthing like checking the length of the phone number to see if its right and that the email ends with somthing valid like .com or .edu and more.
- I also want to incorporate a way to check if the zip code is valid by making sure its 5 digdets long.
- I also want to expand on the subjects and add more tutors so that the user can have more options and choose the tutor they would like.
- I want to make they website look more presentable so that it could attract more users 
- I want to add a reviews page so I can get the feedback of the user to see whats working and what the website needs improvement on.
